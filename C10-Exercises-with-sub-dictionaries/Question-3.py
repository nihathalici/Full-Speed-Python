"""
Take the following dictionary:

students = {
    "Peter": {"age": 10, "address": "Lisbon"},
    "Isabel": {"age": 11, "address": "Sesimbra"},
    "Anna": {"age": 9, "address": "Lisbon"},
}

3. Implement a function that receives the students dict and an address, and returns a list
with the name of all students which address matches the address in the argument.
For instance, invoking "find_students(students, â€™Lisbonâ€™)" should return Peter and Anna.
